Instructions include - 

open the index.html
make the div elements 30% of the window size
make this change only for the devices that are wider than or equal to 992px
set the margin to 10px on all sides for each column for the devices that are wider than or equal to 992px
keep the full size width for the devices below the 992px
remove the left and right margin for the devices below the 992px
use the mobile-first approach

Many thanks,
